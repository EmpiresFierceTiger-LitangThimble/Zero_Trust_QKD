# Simulation of Zero-Trust Multipath QKD
The simulation is focused on collecting Attack Success Rate vs. Attacker Pervasiveness data using one of the principle of zero-trust: continuous verification.

In the simulation, the attacker may occupy nodes at any time. The trust score of each node is updated continuously, and the path selection changes based on trust degradation and time-varying attacks.
